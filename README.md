# SantaBot

A Discord bot to organize secret santa gift exchanges using the discord.py Python library + some other admin-type stuff for my server

- This bot code must be forked/pulled and run locally
- If you don't want the admin-type stuff, just go in and comment out the add_cog(SantaAdministrative(...)) line

### Requirements
- python 3.5.3 or later (can be installed [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- pip3

### Steps to run:
1. Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
2. Once all of the dependencies are installed, create a Discord bot token following the instructions [here](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token).
3. Replace `discord_token` and `client_id` in CONFIG.py with your bot token - these two are REQUIRED for all functionality and for the bot to even start
  3a. Replace other variables in CONFIG.py as you want
      - `role_channel` is necessary for using reaction roles
      - `bot_folder` this is where the .cfg file for the Secret Santa participants and the debug log are stored
      - `prefix` change it to whatever you want otherwise commands default to YOUR_PREFIX_HEREjoin, YOUR_PREFIX_HEREunpin_all, etc.
      - `cfg_path` and `dbg_path` don't need to do anything here
4. Run `python3 santa-bot.py`
